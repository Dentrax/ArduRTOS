## What It Is

**ArduRTOS for Arduino® FreeRTOS Library**

ArduRTOS guide is an easy and advanced way to learn FreeRTOS programming. It will contribute greatly to both a hobby and a school lesson.

## How To Use

Just research the **[main repository](https://github.com/Dentrax/ArduRTOS)** and learn it gradually. Thats all.

 **WARNING:** `Before looking at the exams, please try to solve it yourself first. It's more important than anything. It's a key to success.`


## Features

* Suitable for new FreeRTOS learners

* Suitable CS101 content

* Suitable for midterm and final exams

* More than 10+ example content for every chapter

* Rich content with screenshots and circuit diagrams (soon)

## Requirements

* You should be familiar with C programming
* You will need a text editor (i.e Sublime Text) or IDE (i.e Arduino IDE)
* You will need an Arduino electronic programming platform (If you want to test with USB cable) - (Skip this if you have an Arduino Virtual Simulator or Proteus)
* You will need a computer on which you have the rights to install Arduino dependencies

## Dependencies

* Arduino Development Libaries (for building)
* The FreeRTOS Kernel for Arduino (Arduino_FreeRTOS.h)

## About

ArduRTOS was created to serve three purposes:

**ArduRTOS is a basically FreeRTOS programming learning repository coded in Arduino/C language using Arduino IDE**

1. To act as a guide to learn basic Arduino/C programming with enhanced and rich content

2. To provide a simplest and easiest way to learn detailed and interesting things about FreeRTOS

3. There is a source for you to develop yourself in RTOS and inreace your Arduino programming level

## Branches

We publish source for the **[ArduRTOS]** in single rolling branch:

The **[master branch](https://github.com/dentrax/ArduRTOS/tree/master)** is extensively tested and makes a great starting point for learning the RTOS. Also tracks [live changes](https://github.com/dentrax/ArduRTOS/commits/master) by commits.
